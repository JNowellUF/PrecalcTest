<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Simply put, the goal of this course is to prepare one for Survey of Calculus
(MAC2233) or, in conjunction with a trigonometry class (MAC1114), for Analytic
Geometry and Calculous One (MAC2311). <br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent">More conceptually however, the real goal of this course is to teach how to problem
solve and use mathematical reasoning in an industrial or professional setting. Often
the process of modeling and reasoning are devalued or even sacrificed entirely in an
effort to teach the mechanical skills of arithmetic. This is typically met with
exasperation and confusion by students who ask ”What’s the point of learning
this?”, which is a valid question in any classroom. Unfortunately the point of
learning mathematics is not the computation aspect, but the reasoning and
modelings aspects... those very things that are often pushed out in an effort to
improve the more easily assessed computational skills. So, a more simply
put, if far less simple, answer, is ”The goal of this course is to teach you to
’think’.”
