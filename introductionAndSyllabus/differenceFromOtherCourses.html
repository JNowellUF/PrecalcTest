<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">What makes this course different from previous courses?
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>This course is under development as it is being rewritten from the ground up with
a more practical use in mind, using more modern education theory techniques and
emphasizing more mathematical concepts rather than raw techniques in isolation.
Being in development has up and downsides. There is a video covering this
below:
<div class="video youtube-player" data-youtube="x4p89W85qFQ">_</div>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">In most math courses in the past you have likely been taught mechanics of
mathematics; the computational tools like adding, subtracting, multiplying and
dividing. These are definitely important things, but they are not what math <em>is</em>. To
use an analogy, “learning math” by learning these mechanical skills, would be like
trying to learn a foreign language by reading a translation dictionary. The vocabulary
is important, but reading a dictionary is dry and dull and still doesn’t teach you any
of the important aspects of the foreign language (eg grammar, culture, history,
etc).
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Thus, this class is going to embrace the other aspects of mathematics you may not
have had to learn in the past (or at least, not learn as deeply). This means that this
class will often seem fundamentally at odds with what you think of when you think
of a “math class”. My hope is that you will find this class more engaging and
helpful; but regardless of the outcome, the techniques that will be discussed
will be very different than what you have experienced in the past. I would
recommend that you try to come to this class with an open mind and not
treat this as “just another math class”. With any luck, that will be a good
thing.
