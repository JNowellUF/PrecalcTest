<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">Contextual Based Learning (CBT) has many virtues, knowing why we are learning
how we are will help your studying and learning process.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">It usually surprises people to learn that most mathematicians have spectacularly
terrible memories. In a setting where most of your “math” education is centered
around endless memorizing of symbols and symbol manipulation, it may seem like
you’re suppose to memorize everything. In fact, this is the <em>exactly opposite</em> of how
math should be learned.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent">In reality, memorizing something is very different than learning it. Often you start
with memorizing, but think about this; if you were to see a word, let’s say the word
“toast”, you know what that means. But, do you know what it means because you
memorized it? Or do you know what it means because you’ve simply seen and used it
so much that you “just know it”? Chances are, when you read that word you just
sort of “knew” what it meant, and it might have even evoked an idea of tasty (or
awful... if you’re some kind of barbarian) breakfast food. In contrast, if you
read the word “<script type="math/tex">\dot {\alpha }\pi o \pi \upsilon \rho \dot {\iota }\alpha \varsigma </script>”, chances are that not only would you not know that it’s
ancient greek for “toast”, but you <em>would know</em> that it’s not English. Is that
because you’ve memorized every English word? Or have you memorized
every Non-English word? That’s pretty unlikely, rather you’ve probably
<em>learned</em> how to recognize if something is English or not (such as the funky
alphabet).
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">This is the fundamental difference between memorization and learning. If you learn
something then it becomes “obvious” what contexts make sense for that thing, and
what contexts don’t. <strong>Mathematics is the language of deductive reasoning</strong>, and
just like English, it should be obvious when what you’ve written makes sense and
when it doesn’t. Thus if you ever find yourself in the situation of writing something
down because “that’s what I’m suppose to do” and can’t give any better justification,
chances are that you’ve memorized something, but haven’t learned it yet. This also
means you should talk to your TA or myself in order to transition from
“memorizing” to “learning” the concepts of this class. It will save you vast
amounts of brain space and effort (after all, consider how many words you
know, and how relatively little effort you have to spend to maintain that
knowledge).
