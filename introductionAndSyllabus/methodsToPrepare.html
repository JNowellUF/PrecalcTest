</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
Mathematics is something that needs to be practiced to learn and understand it. In
many cases this means that students are given hordes of practice problems and told
to complete them all for a grade; the hope being that you will gain understanding by
repetition. Unfortunately in my experience, students often memorize the process, but
don’t stop to consider <em>why</em> they are doing whatever they are doing (something often
exasperated by not getting a satisfactory answer to the ”why am I doing
this” question). Although there is definitely value in repetitious practice,
the value is usually gained by hoping that the repetition does one of two
things;
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (a) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">More  practice  means  it  is  less  likely  to  make  simple  computational
     mistakes.  Your  teachers/professors  are  usually  not  much  better  at
     computation  than  you  are,  but  they  have  vastly  more  experience  and
     practice, meaning they make far fewer mistakes.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (b) </dt><dd class="enumerate-enumitem">The “why does this work” will suddenly “click” into place. The hope is
     that by repeatedly practicing, the human instinct of pattern recognition
     will suddenly pick up on the underlying structure that is making whatever
     technique you are practicing suddenly clear as to why it works. Although
     this happens (and is often necessary, especially in higher level math) it
     can only happen if the student is looking for it. So the “turn my brain off
     and get this done” approach is usually rather antithetical to the intent of
     the homework.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">This means that it is important, not only to practice the skills we discuss, but to
constantly ask yourself the following questions; </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Why does this work?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What steps are necessary (and what steps are not necessary), for a given
     problem?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What else could I use this technique on?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What does this technique really require?</li></ul>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent">My teaching philosophy is to put the impetus (responsibility) of learning on the
student. I will answer any questions, and provide limitless practice in the form of
reviews (see the syllabus for more information). Your TAs (and other TAs, and I)
have office hours you can come and ask questions and get more information/help to
understand techniques and content. But in the end it comes down to this: You get
out of this course what you put into it. If you don’t do any optional work,
you will be lucky to pass the class, and you will <em>definitely not</em> pass calculus
