<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">This is the syllabus for the course with everything but grading and the calendar
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
This is MAC1140 ”Precalculus Algebra”. The goal of this course is to provide the
mechanical and conceptual tools necessary to continue on to MAC2311 ”Calculus
One” except for trigonometry, which can be taken separately by taking MAC1114
”Trigonometry”. Alternatively one can take the accelerate combined Precalculus
algebra and trigonometry class MAC1147.
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">A minimum grade of C (not C-) in MAC 1140 satisfies four credits of the university
General Education Math requirement.
<a id="Q1-1-1"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Prerequisites</h5>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">MAC1140 does not require any prerequisites, but it does assume basic numerical
literacy. Students should be able to do basic arithmetic without a calculator. If the
pace or level of course material appears to be beyond your experience I
highly suggest you look into taking MAC1105 ”College Algebra” instead. You
may switch courses at <a href="https://student.ufl.edu/" class="url">https://student.ufl.edu/</a> during the drop-add
period.
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Course Materials</h5>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">There are no required materials for this course; specifically there is no required
textbook, clicker, or online homework code that you must purchase for this
course.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent">In this course we will utilize a free online homework system known as Xronos. This
work is supported by the Office of the Provost and the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences. The platform is accessible through the Canvas site. More details will be
given in class.

<strong>You are responsible for verifying that your grades are accurate. There is
no grade dispute at the end of the semester</strong> (see below for the One Week
Policy).
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>One Week Policy</h5>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent">Please be aware of the <strong>One Week Policy</strong>: Once you receive a graded paper back,
you have <strong>one week</strong> to contest the grade and initiate any grade disputes. Once this
one week passes, <strong>there are no further disputes</strong>. In particular, once the end of the
semester nears, you <em>cannot</em> start disputing, say, grades from the first week or
two.
<a id="Q1-1-9"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Calculators</h5>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent">A graphing calculator and Wolframalpha are useful as study and learning tools when
used appropriately, <strong>but they are not essential.</strong> I also recommend the
online graphing calculator Desmos (<a href="www.desmos.com" class="url">www.desmos.com</a>), and the app GeoGebra
(<a href="www.geogebra.org" class="url">www.geogebra.org</a>) to help you as you learn the material, but mathematics is a
collection of ideas that are not mastered through calculator skills. <strong>No calculators
are allowed on quizzes or exams.</strong>

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000"></a>Lectures</h5>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">This course serves a number of goals. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">First and foremost this course is intended to get studens prepared for
     the  UF  calculus  sequence.  The  calculus  sequence  is  <em>considerably</em> more
     rigorous and difficult than high school or advanced placement (AP) type
     courses, and the precalculus courses are similarly much more difficult in
     preparation of this. In particular, even students that routinely have gotten
     A’s in their math courses in high school will likely find this course quite
     challenging.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This course also aims to get everyone on the same mathematical level in
     terms of notation, communication, and terminology before students move
     forward. As such there will inevitably be times when you will find the
     content boring or otherwise elementary. This is because not everyone will
     be familiar with any given aspect, which means we must cover everything
     to some extent. However, due to the quantity of material that we need to
     cover from this, each of these excursions will be only a brief overview.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">In this course we also aim to instill the basics of mathematical reasoning.
     This means teaching how to problem solve when presented with content
     that  is  otherwise  unfamiliar.  Importantly  this  means  that  <em>you  should
     expect to be confronted with problems that you have not seen before</em>. If you
     have always had problems that are variations of problems that have been
     demonstrated for you already, then your teachers have done you a grave
     disservice.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong>Expect to have to reason and think on the fly during exams,
     quizzes, and homework.</strong> You will almost certainly see questions on
     your assessments that are unfamiliar. Remember that part of lecture is
     teaching you <strong>how to recognize aspects of a problem to see what
     techniques to use</strong>.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Finally, remember that math, by it’s nature, is cumulative. If an exam has
     listed content that will be tested, that means that the content is the <em>focus</em>
     of the exam, but <em>not the only skills necessary for the exam</em>. Clearly we will
     not list on every exam things like ‘addition’ or ‘multiplication’ as exam
     topics. Similarly, most of the content that we will cover in this class, by
     it’s nature, will be used in future content of this same course. Thus you
     should consider all exams as “cumulative” with the listed content for the
     exam being the primary <em>focus</em> of the exam.</li></ul>
<a id="Q1-1-13"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-7000"></a>Incomplete Policy</h5>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent">A grade of I (incomplete) will be considered only if you meet the Math Department
criteria which is found at <a href="http://www.math.ufl.edu" class="url">http://www.math.ufl.edu</a>. If you meet the criteria you
must see the instructor before the beginning of finals week to be considered for an I.
A grade of I only allows you to make up your incomplete work. You cannot redo any
previously completed work.
<a id="Q1-1-15"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-8000"></a>Online Course Evaluation</h5>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent">Students are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course
by completing online evaluations at <a href="https://evaluations.ufl.edu" class="url">https://evaluations.ufl.edu</a>. Evaluations are
typically open during the last two or three weeks of the semester, but students will be
given specific times when they are open. Summary results of these assessments are
available to students at <a href="https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/" class="url">https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results/</a>.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-9000"></a>Advising and Help</h5>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent">For all concerns with MAC1140, please talk to your TA! Office hours will be posted
and are regular times when they are available to answer questions, discuss grades,
advise students on future classes, or help students in any available way. You
do <strong>not</strong> need an appointment to visit during office hours. If you need to
meet outside of office hours, please contact your TA for an appointment.
