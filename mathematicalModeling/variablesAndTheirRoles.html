Here is a video on variables and their roles;
<div class="video youtube-player" data-youtube="uWp4HFE3PJo">_</div>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">To best understand variables and their roles, let’s revisit the patio situation and
consider each of the pieces of data as “potential generalized data”. In our patio
example we might consider the following pieces of data; </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The length and width of the (rectangular) patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The area of the patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost of the cement pavers.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The size (dimensions; length and width) of a single cement paver.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The number of necessary cement pavers to make the patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost of labor to build the patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The time to build the patio.</li></ul>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem1"><a id="x1-5r1"></a>When trying to determine which piece of data should be represented by which type of
variable, it is helpful to consider how each piece of data is related to the others. For
example, the length and width of the patio could give you the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice2"><a id="x1-6r2"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice1">cost</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice2">area</span><span class="choice  " id="choice3">size</span>
</span>, so those things are related (but notice that, having the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice3"><a id="x1-7r3"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice4">cost</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice5">area</span><span class="choice  " id="choice6">size</span>
</span> doesn’t give you enough information to determine both length and width). The area
of the patio and size of an individual paver is similarly related to the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice4"><a id="x1-8r4"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice7">number</span><span class="choice  " id="choice8">value</span><span class="choice  " id="choice9">size</span>
</span> of cement pavers one needs to build the patio with the pavers. Moreover, with a
minimal amount of effort (and some basic geometry and algebra) we could write
down these relationships mathematically.   <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotei&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[1]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotei" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(These are mathematical relationships
and functions, which we will cover in more detail later. For now we simply
state what the relationships are between the specific pieces of data we have.)</span>

     approximately here as there is some difficulty in the situation where the
     pavers don’t exactly line up with the dimensions of the patio; eg if the
     patio is fifteen and two thirds of a paver long, it would likely require more
     paver purchases than this estimate suggests.)</span> </span></span> the (Area of the Patio)

<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent">Look at the list above and try to read them out loud. Really; go do it. How far did
you get before you stopped to come back and read this because it was obnoxious to
read all those words for “such obvious relationships”? It should be clear that,
although we have to write phrases like “Area of Pavers” and “Width of Patio”, it
would be a lot easier if we could encode this information in something faster and
easier to read; after all, we know what we mean right?</p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnoteiii&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[3]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnoteiii" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(This phrase is often used
and almost <em>always</em> regretted at some point.)</span> </span></span> This is where variables come into
play. We could build an encoding, a kind of “quick reference sheet” for a
shorthand to refer to these things. An example of such a thing might be the
following;
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><script type="math/tex">n</script> is the number of bricks needed to build our patio.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>So what does this have to do with variable types?</h5>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment exploration" id="problem7"> <strong>   2 :</strong>  <a id="x1-2001r7"></a>  The next step is formalizing the relationship between these variables. This is
something we will cover much more in the next topic, but for now we could
probably conclude the following relationship from the above variables; <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> A_p = L_p \cdot W_p </script> Which
tells us that the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice8"><a id="x1-2002r8"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice13">(length of the patio)</span><span class="choice  " id="choice14">(width of the patio)</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice15">(area of the
patio)</span>
</span> is equal to the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice9"><a id="x1-2003r9"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice16">(length of the patio)</span><span class="choice  " id="choice17">(area of the patio)</span>
</span> times the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice10"><a id="x1-2004r10"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice18">(width of the patio)</span><span class="choice  " id="choice19">(area of the patio)</span>
</span>; the basic formula for the area of a rectangle. Observe that with any two of these
pieces of data, we could get the third (eg with width and total area, we could
calculate the length). So the question is, what does our model expect to have
provided to it, and what do we want our model to tell us? Take the following two
examples:
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem11"><a id="x1-2005r11"></a>You’re given length and width.
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent">Let’s say you work for a construction company and you are asked to make a model to
determine the price of building a patio for a customer. That customer has very
specific dimensions that they want, and so you know you will be given the length and
width of the patio, but your calculations require area. In this case you would use the
original equation above; <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> A_p = L_p \cdot W_p </script> Here the relationship between these variables in your model
expects to have you supply <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice12"><a id="x1-2006r12"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice20">length and width</span><span class="choice  " id="choice21">area and length</span><span class="choice  " id="choice22">area and
width</span>
</span> of the patio (the given information from your customer) and it will in turn calculate
the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice13"><a id="x1-2007r13"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice23">area</span><span class="choice  " id="choice24">width</span><span class="choice  " id="choice25">length</span>
</span> of the patio.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem14"><a id="x1-2008r14"></a>You’re given Area and width
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent">Now let’s say a customer is planning an above-ground pool. They know they
need a certain amount of minimum square footage to have a foundation for
their pool, a grill, and a lounge area. Furthermore they know they want
the patio to run the full width of their main porch area. So when building
the model, you want to build it assuming you will know the area and the
                                                                  

                                                                  
width, but not the length. Thus you would use the following relationship;
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> L_p = \frac {A_p}{W_p} </script>
</p></div>
</div>
<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent">In both these cases we have the same variables and the model has the same end goal
(to calculate the cost to build a patio), but in one situation we expect to know the
length and width, but need the area. In the other situation you expect to know the
area and width, but need the length.

<div role="article" class="problem-environment exploration" id="problem15"> <strong>   3 :</strong>  <a id="x1-2009r15"></a>  Although we call <script type="math/tex">A_p</script>, <script type="math/tex">L_p</script>, and <script type="math/tex">W_p</script> ‘variables’ in both cases, we have special names to
denote this “expectation” aspect that is, in some sense, equally important to include
in a model. <em>For variables that we expect to be provided to us, we call them
<strong>independent variables</strong></em>. They are called “independent” because they are (suppose
to be) supplied independent of the model, meaning that they are the data that
is “fed into” the model to get results. <em>The variables that are calculated or
deduced by the model are called <strong>dependent variables</strong></em>. These variables are call
dependent because their value depends on what is put into the model (ie the

and especially inverse functions.)</span> </span></span> change value for different independent
variable values). In general, if you (for a moment) think of a model as a
magic machine, then independent variables are ‘fed into’ that machine, and
dependent variables are ‘spit back out’ as your “answers”.  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotevi&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[6]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotevi" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(“Answers” here is
in quotes as dependent variables often occur in substeps of models. In our
examples above, our real “answer” would be the cost of the patio, whereas the
dependent variables (the area in the first example and length in the second) are
“answers” to their respective equations but one would typically not call them
an “answer” to the model, which tends to be what we mean when we say
“The Answer”. This is why using words like “solution” or “answer” can be
dangerous, and <em>one should always be clear as to what they are claiming their

that there was no comment made in our definition about a certain letter needing
to be a certain type of variable. In fact we demonstrated that the same

in calculus is the <em>arbitrary constant</em>. This is typically a result of some initial
information used in your model, and is a byproduct of choices in your model, but
<em>they are unaffected by independent variables</em>. One can think of the arbitrary
constant as being a sort of “starting spot” for your model. That is to say, even
though your “starting spot” is typically of great importance to your outcome
(your starting height when throwing a ball and measuring how far it goes
for example) no matter what information you “feed into” the model (eg
throwing speed, throwing angle, etc), your starting spot doesn’t change.
Thus the arbitrary constant doesn’t change based on any of these “input”
values.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="noindent">One might wonder what the difference is, then, between a constant and an arbitrary
constant. It may be clear that it doesn’t vary based on independent variables, so it
seems like it is constant. The key point though is that you may not know the
intended “starting spot” (ie the height someone will throw from) of your model when
you are designing it.
</p><!--l. 113--><p class="noindent">Consider our patio example again. You are building a generic model to calculate the
cost of building a patio for your company, and part of that is travel costs. The
travel costs themselves will depend on the location (where the customer lives,
how accessible the construction site is, etc). But once you have determined
the cost for travel, it won’t change depending on the size of the patio (the
independent variable). Thus it will be a constant value, but one that depends on
the customer’s location, not the customer’s specific project. This is cost
would then be an arbitrary constant; something that varies from project to
project (specific model to specific model) but is constant within the specific
model.
