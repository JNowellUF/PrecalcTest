<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Although we aren’t quite ready to get into true “models”, what we discussed in the
last topic might most conveniently be described as a “numeric model.”</p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotei&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[1]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotei" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;"> 
<span style="color:#4D00B2;">(Technically “numeric model” refers to a product of a numeric approximation method
that we won’t be discussing in this class. In our case however we mean simply that
the “model” was entirely number-driven without using variables, abstracting
or generalizing)</span> </span></span> Another way of thinking about what we did in the last
topic, is that we reasoned our way to a solution to the problem we were
given. But how do you go from all those observations and statements, to
something you can attach numbers to? How do you go from “how much
would it cost to build a patio” to “I will need approximately 300 pavers at $<script type="math/tex">2.50</script>
each”?
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">This is where it is important to recognize <em>types</em> of information. Information comes
in many different types. In this class we will cover some specific types of
information that are best handled by the mathematical reasoning process</p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script> 
 <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnoteii&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[2]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnoteii" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(Note that this doesn’t include all types. For example there are many
unquantifiable forms of information that we will rarely discuss here, including most of
what is studied in humanities disciplines like History or Philosophy, and
even in some other scientific fields like psychology.)</span> </span></span>, but before we narrow
our focus to that it is worthwhile to at least recognize a few other types of
information.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent">At it’s most basic level we could define “information” as “a collection of knowledge or
observations used to problem solve”. Even this definition is a little lackluster (as are
most definitions when it comes to trying to define anything as nebulous
as “information”). Nonetheless, you want to think of information as the
basic blocks you use to build some method of solving the problem in front of
you. Just like anything you build however, it’s important to know what the
strengths and weaknesses of your building materials are, and information
is no exception. Here are some key types of information for our purposes:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><strong>Quantifiable  Information:</strong> Information  that  can  be  numerically  or
     algebraically represented (but may not be yet, see Data below); eg the
     design of the patio or the fact that bricks are available to buy at the local
     hardware store.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong>Data:</strong> Data is Quantifiable Information that has been quantified. This
     is a gray line; data is rarely distinguished from quantifiable information.
     An example might be that the “quantifiable information” would be that a
     brick can be bought with money (ie there is some number that corresponds
     to it’s cost) whereas the “data” would be the specific cost of the brick
     (eg the brick costs $<script type="math/tex">2.50</script>). In one case we have information that tells us there
     exists a piece of data (a number), but we don’t have it yet, whereas in the
     other case we have the actual data (number) already.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><strong>Extraneous  Information:</strong>  Information  that  is  not  relevant  to  the
     problem solving process/method you are using. This is often (somewhat
     paradoxically) the most important type of information, in that recognizing
     that some piece of knowledge can be ignored is often the key to seeing how
     a solution can be achieved. In our example; if you keep spending all your
     time trying to quantify the relative costs of paint colors and you don’t
     stop to ask if the patio is going to be painted, then you are wasting a lot
     of time if it turns out that paint isn’t necessary.</li></ul>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment problem" id="problem1"> <strong>    1 :</strong>  <a id="x1-5r1"></a>  Why do we focus primarily on quantifiable types of information? <div class="multiple-choice" id="problem2"><span class="choice  " id="choice1">In the
real world, only information that can be boiled down to an effect on a bottom line; ie
numbers, are important.</span> <span class="choice  " id="choice2">The only thing we know how to deal with in
science is numbers.</span> <span class="choice correct " id="choice3">This is a math course which focuses around algebra and
numbers; other courses focus on other types of information as appropriate.</span> <span class="choice

apply) <div class="select-all" id="problem4"><a id="x1-7r3"></a> <span class="choice  " id="choice6">It’s not. By definition.</span> <span class="choice correct " id="choice7">Because knowing what information to not include
can actually dramatically simplify a problem.</span> <span class="choice correct " id="choice8">In the real world you just about
always get random information that isn’t useful. Weeding out that information is an
important skill.</span> <span class="choice  " id="choice9">Because that is the information we will use to solve the
