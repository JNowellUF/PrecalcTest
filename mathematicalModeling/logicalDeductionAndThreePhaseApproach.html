Here is an example video:

<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Let’s revisit the previous example and work through it to get a solution. This will
highlight the reasoning process, and in the following lectures we will work through
each of the reasoning steps in more detail.
<a id="Q1-1-1"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Phase One: Statement and clarification of the problem</h5>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem1"><a id="x1-1001r1"></a>The first step in any problem, is the problem itself. This may seem obvious and
trivial, but it’s unfortunately the case that what someone <em>asks</em> of you, and what they
<em>want</em> of you, are often not the same. So, even though it seems like the first phase is
given for free (that is, that you have to be asked a problem in order to start problem
solving) the truth is that often the first step is clarifying what someone has asked of
you until you can concretely describe what they want. Let’s look at our patio
example.
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent">The original question was simply “How much would it cost to build a patio?”
However, this is entirely too vague. The desired answer is clearly quantifiable (they
want cost, a number, as an answer after all), but the given information “a patio” isn’t
quantifiable. Before we can give a quantified answer then, we need to clarify the
question into something we can assign numbers to.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent">How one goes about this can vary, but at the very least we should ask the most basic
questions, such as: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">What is the patio made of?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What <em>is</em> a patio, or more specifically, what is a patio to the person asking
     the question? (Pro-tip: Never assume the person asking a question is using
     the same precise vocabulary you are).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">How big does the person want the patio? Specific dimensions (numbers!)
     are preferable.</li></ul>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent">After some back and forth questioning you determine that the patio is going to be
                                                                  

                                                                  
made of cement paving stones, and encompass a flat area of between 15 and 20 feet
on each side.
</p></div>
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Phase Two: Quantifying the situation, ie turning Information into Data</h5>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem2"><a id="x1-2001r2"></a>The next step is to start figuring out relevant numbers and their relationship. This is
usually where you discover any other numbers that you need which are missing. Let’s
continue our patio example;
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">We now know that the patio is made of cement paving stones, and that we want a
surface between 15 and 20 feet on each side to be covered with them. Clearly, if we
are trying to determine cost, we should know the cost of something. Hopefully it’s
clear that, since we are using cement paving stones to cover the surface, we need to
know the cost of those paving stones, but that’s not quite enough. We also need to
know how many paving stones it will take to cover the given surface. After a quick
trip to the local building supply store, you determine that cement paving stones
are around $<script type="math/tex">2.50</script> each, and are about a foot and a half long and a half foot
wide.
</p></div>
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Phase Three: Developing your (numeric) answer</h5>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment example" id="problem3"><a id="x1-3001r3"></a>Now we have all the information (data) that we need to determine an answer. Since
the given question (and followup clarification) specified between 15 and 20 feet on a
side (ie a range of possibilities), our answer should likewise be a range of
possibilities. To get the minimum cost, it makes sense that we would build
the smallest possible area, a fifteen by fifteen foot patio. Likewise, to get
the highest cost we would build the largest patio, a twenty by twenty foot
area.
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent">It would take ten pavers stacked end to end (the long way) to cover fifteen feet, and
then it would take thirty of them stacked side by side to attain fifteen feet. Thus to
completely cover a fifteen by fifteen foot patio with cement pavers, we would need <script type="math/tex">10 \cdot 30 = \answer {300}</script>
pavers at $<script type="math/tex">2.50</script> each, for a total cost of $<script type="math/tex">\answer {750}</script>. Using similar calculations we find that we need
approximately 520 cement pavers to cover a twenty by twenty foot patio, for a total
cost of $<script type="math/tex">1300</script>.
</p></div>
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Is that it?</h5>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent">The above is a basic example of using mathematical reasoning to answer a problem.
But it can be used to do much more than that. To do so, we will introduce the idea
                                                                  

                                                                  
of Modeling in the next lecture, and see how mathematical reasoning can be used to
build a more general answer (after all; where did those equations come from in the
example box?)
