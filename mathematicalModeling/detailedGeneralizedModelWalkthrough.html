<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">This is intended as a detailed walkthrough to give students an idea of what a
<em>complete and thorough</em> process of generalizing a model looks like. Keep in mind this is
the ideal, and in practice it is often the case that they are messier and/or lack some
data. Moreover, because this is still early in the precalculus class, this model will be
simplified in terms of the depth of detail we consider when we are building the
generalized model.
<a id="Q1-1-1"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-10001"></a>The Given Problem</h5>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">You have recently been hired by a local company to streamline their billing and
customer interaction process. The company specializes in building brick patios, and
they supply you with the following information;
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">They make primarily rectangular patios, so they wish to have some kind
     of model to provide the cost of any requested rectangular patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The bricks they currently use are 6 inches by 3 inches and cost $<script type="math/tex">1.25</script> per brick.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The company charges $<script type="math/tex">100</script> per hour for labor, and they can usually put down
     about fifty square feet worth of brick in that time.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The company doesn’t charge for travel or terrain preparation (they only
     do local work).</li></ul>
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-20001"></a>Step One: Identifying data worth generalizing</h5>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent">Armed with the information they provided, you decide to start by determining what
individual pieces of data there are, and then determining which might be worthy of
generalizing into variables. You come up with the following list of (possibly relevant)
data;
</p>
                                                                  

                                                                  
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The dimensions of the bricks that are used.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The dimensions of the patio that they are going to build
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost of the bricks that are used.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The amount and cost of labor that is necessary to build the patio.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">the incidental costs such as; travel, stone dust, terrain preparation, lunches,
     etc.</li></ul>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent">Upon further reflection on your list, you determine that the incidental costs <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice2"><a id="x1-2001r2"></a><span class="choice " id="choice1">are</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice2">aren’t</span>
</span> relevant because the company’s owner specifically told you that they don’t charge
for these things and that it is considered somewhere else in the price system that
they gave you. Moreover, the dimensions and cost of the bricks are <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice3"><a id="x1-2002r3"></a><span class="choice " id="choice3">variable</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice4">constant</span><span class="choice " id="choice5">arbitrary constants</span>
</span> , and the cost of labor <em>per hour</em> is <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice4"><a id="x1-2003r4"></a><span class="choice " id="choice6">variable</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice7">constant</span><span class="choice " id="choice8">arbitrary constants</span>
</span>, although the amount of hours necessary for a given job will vary according
to the size of the patio. So, you need to at least generalize the dimensions
of the patio that is being built (this is supplied by the customer after all).
Moreover you will need to have some kind of <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice5"><a id="x1-2004r5"></a><span class="choice correct" id="choice9">variable</span><span class="choice " id="choice10">constant</span><span class="choice " id="choice11">arbitrary
constants</span>
</span> for the amount of labor needed and thus the cost of labor.
<a id="Q1-1-5"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-30005"></a>Step Two: Assigning and recording variables explicitly (and carefully)</h5>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent">Using the above data, you research and create the following references:
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The dimensions of bricks are 3 inches by 6 inches; which means you need
     8 bricks to fill 1 square foot.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The dimensions of the patio are unknown and are specifically assigned as
     independent variables. We will choose:
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize"><script type="math/tex">L =</script> <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice6"><a id="x1-3001r6"></a><span class="choice correct" id="choice12">length</span><span class="choice " id="choice13">width</span>
         </span> of patio
                                                                  

                                                                  
         </li>
         <li class="itemize"><script type="math/tex">W =</script> <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice7"><a id="x1-3002r7"></a><span class="choice " id="choice14">length</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice15">width</span>
         </span> of patio
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">You determine that knowing the explicit area of the patio may be helpful,
         so you denote this with <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost of the bricks are known to be $<script type="math/tex">1.25</script> per brick. Since 1 square foot is <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice8"><a id="x1-3003r8"></a><span class="choice " id="choice16">12</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice17">8</span><span class="choice " id="choice18">4</span>
     </span> bricks, brick costs work out to <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice9"><a id="x1-3004r9"></a><span class="choice " id="choice19">$<script type="math/tex">15</script></span><span class="choice correct" id="choice20">$<script type="math/tex">10</script></span><span class="choice " id="choice21">$<script type="math/tex">5</script></span>
     </span> per square foot.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">You decide to denote the total cost for bricks by <script type="math/tex">T_B</script>.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The amount of labor is unknown, and is a <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice10"><a id="x1-3005r10"></a><span class="choice " id="choice22">independant variable</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice23">dependant
     variable</span><span class="choice " id="choice24">arbitrary constant</span>
     </span> because it depends on how big the patio is.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize"><script type="math/tex">H =</script> hours of work necessary to build the patio.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost per hour of labor is a set rate of $<script type="math/tex">100</script> an hour, so it is <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice11"><a id="x1-3006r11"></a><span class="choice correct" id="choice25">constant</span><span class="choice " id="choice26">arbitrary
     constant</span>
     </span> and doesn’t need a variable.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">The total cost for labor will depend on how long they need to work,
         and will be denote <script type="math/tex">T_W</script>.</li></ul>
     </li></ul>
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-400011"></a>Building relations between variables</h5>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent">Now that you have an explicit reference sheet with variable names and the
constants you may need, you assemble the following relationships between the
variables;
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Area of the patio is Length times Width.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">We record this with the equation: <script type="math/tex">A = LW</script>.</li></ul>
     </li>
                                                                  

                                                                  
     <li class="itemize">The cost of the bricks will be the cost per square foot of bricks, times the area
     (in square feet) of the patio.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">We record this with the equation: <script type="math/tex">T_B = 10 \cdot A</script></li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The amount of labor will be the total area of the patio divided by the <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice12"><a id="x1-4001r12"></a><span class="choice " id="choice27">20</span><span class="choice " id="choice28">40</span><span class="choice correct" id="choice29">50</span>
     </span> square feet per hour they can lay.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">We record this with the equation: <script type="math/tex">H = \dfrac {A}{50}</script></li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The cost of labor will be the hourly wage times the number of hours.
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">We record this with the equation: <script type="math/tex">T_W = 100H</script></li></ul>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Finally, our end goal, the total cost for the patio is the total cost of bricks and
     total cost of labor; which we can write out and simplify using the above
     equations as follows:
     <!--l. 108--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \begin {array}{ll | r} T_P &= T_B + T_W & \text { \textbf {Step explanation}}\\ &= (10A) + (100H) & \text { Since }T_B = 10A and T_W = 100H\\ &= 10(LW) + 100\left (\dfrac {A}{50}\right ) & \text { Since }A = LW and H = \dfrac {A}{50}\\ &= 10(LW) + 100\left (\dfrac {LW}{50}\right ) & \text { Since }A = LW\\ &= 10LW + 2LW & \text { Simplifying the fraction}\\ &= 12LW \end {array} </script>
</p>
     </li></ul>
<a id="Q1-1-9"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-500012"></a>Conclusion</h5>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent">So we have built a generalized model to calculate the cost of a patio that is <script type="math/tex">L</script> feet long
by <script type="math/tex">W</script> feet wide, and come up with the final answer: <script type="math/tex">T_P = 12LW</script>. Notice that many of the variables
we originally defined for convenience, all ended up being simplified out during the
process of simplifying <script type="math/tex">T_P</script> in the last part above, this is very common when you use
generalized models. It is still helpful to have those variables ‘lurking’ in the
background however; in case, for instance, the company’s owner wants to know how
much of his bill is actually materials versus labor... all the information is already
there in your model, it just isn’t displayed by the ‘final calculation’ that you supply
at the end.
