<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">These are important terms and notations for this section.
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem1"><a id="x1-5r1"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Mathematical Reasoning</span> A technique of problem solving that relies on deductive
reasoning and symbolic manipulation.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem2"><a id="x1-6r2"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Deductive Reasoning</span> A form of inference that uses a set of given information, and
extracts new information that <em>must</em> be true as a result. <br class="newline"/>For example (eg): Given the information:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">It has rained
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">There is no cover for the ground</li></ul>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">Then we can deduce that the ground is wet. This would be a logical deduction, or
“deductive reasoning”.
</p></div>

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem3"><a id="x1-7r3"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Information</span> A collection of knowledge or observations used to problem solve.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem4"><a id="x1-8r4"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Data</span> Quantified versions of information.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem5"><a id="x1-9r5"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Model</span> A (collection of) mathematical expressions used to represent a specific
situation.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem6"><a id="x1-10r6"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Generalize</span> A process of going from a (somewhat) specific problem (eg a numeric
model) to a methodology or (Generalized) Model to attain answers to (less specific)
variations of the original problem.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem7"><a id="x1-11r7"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">(Mathematical) Symbol</span> A mathematical symbol (usually referred to simply as
‘symbol’ when context is clear) is a non-numeric piece of writing (typically a letter)
that holds the place of some (typically numeric) value, to be decided (or deduced)
later.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent"><em>The conceptual definition (Not to be used as the actual definition)</em>: A symbol is a
letter, in some alphabet, that is a temporary stand-in for a piece of information. It is
typically either a variable or replaced by a concrete value when one forms a
model.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> This is included as we use the term ’symbol’ many times
throughout this section and thus it should have a formal definition. <strong>However this
term will not be tested on in discussion quizzes or on exams.</strong> It is
necessarily abstract given it’s usage, but the abstraction is so deep as to be beyond
the scope of this course.

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem8"><a id="x1-12r8"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Variable</span> A symbol used to represent an unknown piece of data.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem9"><a id="x1-13r9"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Independant Variable</span> A variable whose value is unspecified, but will be provided by
the statement of the problem.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem10"><a id="x1-14r10"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Dependent Variable</span> A variable whose value is unknown and is generated by the
Model. In most cases dependent variables are determined (solved for) by the Model
(See Arbitrary Constant Below).
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem11"><a id="x1-15r11"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Arbitrary Constant</span> A symbol that is unaffected by independent variables,
and whose value is determined by the model and initial conditions of the
system.
