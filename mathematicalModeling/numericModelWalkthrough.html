<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">This is a detailed numeric model example and walkthrough.
</p></div>   <div class="maketitle"></div>
This is intended as a detailed walkthrough to give students an idea of what a
<em>complete and thorough</em> version of a numeric model is. Keep in mind this is the ideal,
and in practice it is often the case that they are messier and/or lack some data.
Moreover, because this is a numeric model (and a precalculus class) this model will
be simplified in terms of the depth of detail we consider when we are modeling the
given problem.
<a id="Q1-1-1"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>The Given Problem</h5>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">You are a master carpenter with several apprentices and you have been
subcontracted by a large construction company on one of their projects; building
apartments in a new apartment building. You need to have a proposal for what to
charge the company to put kitchen cabinetry in a single apartment.
<a id="Q1-1-3"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Phase One: Clarify and precisely state the problem.</h5>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">You know you need to come up with a number to charge for an apartment’s kitchen
cabinets, but more information is needed. How big is the apartment? How many
cabinets are necessary? What kind/quality of wood is appropriate? (ie is it a high
end luxury apartment, or a low end mass housing apartment for low income
families?) You decide to sit down and brainstorm this initial list of possible things to
consider and/or ask the construction company about to get a better idea of what you
are expected to design. </p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnotei&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[1]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnotei" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(A master carpenter would more easily know
which information to consider and which information is extraneous. You
may consider trying to determine if there is any important information not
considered here, or what information here might be extraneous and why?)</span>

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">After further discussion with the construction company you determine you are
expected to supply fully finished solid cherry construction cabinets with brass
hardware, unpainted but sealed with appropriate chemical sealant. Moreover, they
expect 2-3 occupants per apartment and request between 25 and 40 cubic
feet of storage depending on your own professional recommendation for the
space.

</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-3000"></a>Phase Two: Quantifying the Information.</h5>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent">Now that you have a more technical and precise idea of what is expected, you get to
work determining the structure of the cabinets, the amount of materials required, and
the corresponding costs. You know you need to consider the following things that
contribute to cost;
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Labor: You expect to need 3 apprentice carpenters for three days, for a
     total of seventy two man-hours of work per apartment.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Travel: Travel to and from the work-site would account for $100 per day
     in gas, insurance, and vehicle maintenance.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Raw Materials:
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">Wood: Cherry wood is about $9 a square foot
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">Hardware: Hinges, screws, finishing nails, and handles come to about
         $8 per cabinet.
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">Finishing  Supplies:  An  oil-based  sealant,  sanding  supplies,  and
         decorative carving come to about $3 per cabinet (discounting labor).</li></ul>
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent">After looking through your blueprints and determining the build style and structure,
you conclude that your design will have 37 cubic feet of storage and will need the
                                                                  

                                                                  
following for raw materials;
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Wood: 30 square feet of wood for the top cabinets and 26 square feet for
     the bottom cabinets, for a total of 56 square feet of Cherry.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Hardware: There will be a total of 6 top cabinets and 10 bottom cabinets
     (for the purposes of hardware, drawers are similarly counted as cabinets),
     for a total of 16 ‘cabinets’.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Finishing Supplies: Again there are a total of 16 cabinets.</li></ul>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent">You will also need to account for your own salary, a profit margin, and “slippage” </p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script> 
 <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnoteii&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[2]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnoteii" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(In subcontracting and contracting work, the term slippage is often used to
describe lost materials or labor due to mistakes in either planning or execution. For
example, someone cutting a board too short by accident may mean that you lose a
certain amount of wood that becomes entirely unusable, even for other aspects of
your project.)</span> </span></span>
<a id="Q1-1-7"></a>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Phase Three: Developing your (numeric) answer</h5>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent">Once you have written down all the specifics and quantified them, it is time to
determine the final number to send to the contractors. First you compute the
actual raw cost to you (the master carpenter) of the apartment cabinets,
assuming everything goes perfectly correctly.</p>  <script type="text/javascript"> function footnotefunction(ID) { var x = document.getElementById(ID); if (x.style.display === "none") { x.style.color = "##002db3"; x.style.display = "inline"; } else { x.style.display = "none"; } } </script>   <span style="position=relative; vertical-align=baseline;"> <button onclick="footnotefunction(&#39;footnoteiii&#39;)" style="background:none!important; color:inherit; border:none; padding:0!important; font: inherit; cursor: pointer;"> <sup>[3]</sup> </button>   <span id="footnoteiii" style="display:none; font-family=Verdana, sans-serif; font-size=0.7em; line-height=1.1; display=inline; min-width=20em; position=absolute; left=25px; bottom=5px ; border=1px solid; padding=5px; color:##002db3; word-wrap=break-word; z-index=9999; overflow=auto;">  <span style="color:#4D00B2;">(Spoiler: it never does.)</span>
</span></span>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent">To determine this, we compute the following: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Labor: 3 apprentice carpenters, each paid $25/hr, for 72 man-hours comes to <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice1"><a id="x1-4001r1"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice1">$1000</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice2">$1800</span><span class="choice  " id="choice3">$2800</span>
     </span>. total.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Travel: 3 days at $100 a day comes to <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice2"><a id="x1-4002r2"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice4">$33</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice5">$300</span><span class="choice  " id="choice6">$3000</span>
     </span> total.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Raw Materials:
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize">Wood: 56 square feet of wood at $9 per square foot comes to <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice3"><a id="x1-4003r3"></a><span class="choice correct " id="choice7">$504</span><span class="choice  " id="choice8">$560</span><span class="choice 
         " id="choice9">$1000</span>
         </span> total.
                                                                  

                                                                  
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">Per-Cabinet Costs: For finishing supplies and hardware it was 16 cabinets
         at $11 per cabinet for <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice4"><a id="x1-4004r4"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice10">$80</span><span class="choice  " id="choice11">$100</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice12">$176</span>
         </span> total.</li></ul>
     </li></ul>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent">Thus your total raw expenses are: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> (25\cdot 72) + (3\cdot 100) + (56\cdot 9) + (16\cdot 11) = \$1800 + \$300 + \$504 + \$176 = \$2780 </script> Thus your raw expenses as the subcontractor
come to a total of $2780 per apartment. A general rule of thumb for carpentry is to
expect 10%-15% of raw expenses as ‘slippage‘. You decide to play it a bit safe and
round up, adding $430 as a ‘slippage’ factor. You also need to include your own
salary which is billed at $75 per hour, and you figure you had to contribute the
planning and then oversight time for a total of about 40 hours of work, which is <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice5"><a id="x1-4005r5"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice13">$300</span><span class="choice  " id="choice14">$1800</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice15">$3000</span>
</span>.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="noindent">So you official charging price comes to:
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="noindent"><script type="math/tex; mode=display"> (\$2780 + \$430 + \$ 3000) = \$6210 </script> per apartment.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="noindent">Finally, you always make sure to include some profit margin to guard against
unexpected delays, changes in planning, and various other possible mitigating factors.
So you take the final number of $6210 and add an extra ten percent to be safe. Thus
your final charging price (including the extra ten percent) comes to: <span class="word-choice" id="word-choice6"><a id="x1-4006r6"></a><span class="choice  " id="choice16">$6210</span><span class="choice correct " id="choice17">$6831</span><span class="choice  " id="choice18">$7831</span>
</span>.
<a id="Q1-1-9"></a>
</p>
<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000"></a>Conclusion</h5>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent">After accounting for all the material costs, mitigating charges (charges against
possible complications in the project that you may be held accountable for),
maintenance and transport fees, and labor, you finally come up with a number for
your contractor of $6831 per apartment for cabinets.
