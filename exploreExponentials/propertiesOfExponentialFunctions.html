common errors made with exponential functions.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">We have seen the key properties of exponential expressions and how to manipulate
exponents, but there are significant features of the exponential as a function that are
also important.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Inverting the exponential function</h4>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">One of the more important observations is that the exponential function is
one-to-one, that is it passes the horizontal line test. This means that there
exists an inverse function which we call a logarithm. We will cover the log
function in the next topic, but this is also helpful as it tells us that there <em>is</em> an
inverse, and thus we can figure out how to ‘cancel’ an exponential in some
sense.<br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">Identifying the difference between Polynomial Functions and Exponential
Functions<br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="noindent">It is surprisingly easy to mix up the polynomial functions and exponential function
terms.<br class="newline"/>In general, a polynomial term is one where the base is unknown, but the exponent is
a fixed number. For example <script type="math/tex">(x+1)^3</script> has an unknown base of <script type="math/tex">x + 1</script>, but the exponent is the
(fixed) number <script type="math/tex">3</script>.<br class="newline"/>In contrast, an exponential function is one where the base is a fixed number, but the
power is unknown. For example the function <script type="math/tex">3^{x^2+1}</script> is an exponential function since
the base is the (fixed) number <script type="math/tex">3</script> but the exponent is the (unknown) value
<script type="math/tex">x^2 + 1</script>.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="noindent">Importantly, this means situations that involve <em>both</em> the base <em>and</em> the exponent being
unknown aren’t really polynomials <em>or</em> exponential functions. For example the
function <script type="math/tex">x^x</script> is a surprisingly difficult function to deal with. Despite looking almost like a
polynomial and almost like an exponential, it’s really neither and behaves very
unlike either one depending on what <script type="math/tex">x</script> value range you are considering. Often
                                                                  

                                                                  
functions like this require calculus or numerical approximation methods to
understand.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="noindent">To see how knowing the inverse of a function exists, even if we don’t know what it
is, consider the following equality: <script type="math/tex">3^{2x} = 3^{x+1}</script>. We may not know enough about logs
(yet) to solve this directly using analytic methods, however we know that
the function is one-to-one, meaning that two exponentials with the same
base can <em>only</em> be equal if the powers are equal. Thus in our equality, <script type="math/tex">3^{2x}</script> and <script type="math/tex">3^{x+1}</script>
both have the same base, so they can only be equal if the exponents are
equal. That is, <script type="math/tex">3^{2x} = 3^{x+1}</script> if, and <em>only if </em> <script type="math/tex">2x = x+1</script>. Now we have a simple linear polynomial,
so we can solve to find that <script type="math/tex">x = 1</script>. But what if we have something a bit more
complicated?

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem1"><a id="x1-1001r1"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Determine all <script type="math/tex">x</script> values that satisfy <script type="math/tex">2^{x^2 + 3} = 16^{x}</script></span>Ideally we would want to solve this using the fact
that exponentials with the same base must have the same exponents if they are equal,
but unfortunately we don’t have the same base. However, we could notice that one
base is a power of the other base, specifically <script type="math/tex">16 = 2^4</script>. So the key to this problem is to
replace the larger base with a power of the smaller base; <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 2^{x^2 + 3} = 16^x = \left (2^4\right )^x = 2^{4x} </script> So we know (by the
one-to-one property) that <script type="math/tex">x^2 + 3 = 4x</script>. So, moving the <script type="math/tex">4x</script> over and factoring gives us <script type="math/tex">(x-3)(x-1) = 0</script>, ie <script type="math/tex">x = 1</script> and
<script type="math/tex">x = 3</script>. Sure enough, plugging in these values of <script type="math/tex">x</script> works and we have found our
answer.
