<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem1"><a id="x1-5r1"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Exponent</span> The exponent of a term is the power that the term is being raised to. For
example, the exponent of <script type="math/tex">x^13</script> is <script type="math/tex">13</script>.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem2"><a id="x1-6r2"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Exponentiation</span> Exponentiation is the process of raising a term to a power. For
example, if we have <script type="math/tex">x = 13</script> and “square” both sides, we would say we “exponentiated both
sides by two”. This is primarily of use/interest in industry as it is a much
more common phrase than saying “we raised both sides to the power of
two.”
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem3"><a id="x1-7r3"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Exponential Growth/Decay</span> Exponential Growth (or decay) is any growth (or
decay respectively) whose rate depends upon the current population value
of the growing (or decaying) substance. For example, a population of deer
will have more babies if there are more deer to bread, so it’s (unrestricted)
growth would be an example of exponential growth. In contrast, if a student
has 2 assignments assigned every week, due at the end of the semester, the
workload growth is <em>not</em> an example of exponential growth, as it grows at
the same rate regardless of how many assignments the student currently
has.
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem4"><a id="x1-8r4"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Growth/Decay Multiplier</span> The growth/decay multiplier is the ratio of the size of the
population after one growth/decay cycle to it’s starting population. Thus if you have
a population that goes from 100 to 200 in its first growth cycle, then it’s growth
multiplier is <script type="math/tex">\frac {200}{100} = 2</script>.
