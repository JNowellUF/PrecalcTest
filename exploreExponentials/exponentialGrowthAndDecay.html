<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">Exponential functions have a very specific purpose in models. Exponentials
are used when growth/decay rate of something changes depending on how
much of it you have. For example, a population of animals will increase
faster the more animals you have. After all, if you have more animals, they
can produce more baby animals, which thus increases the population faster.
Similarly, the more debt you have, the more interest it accrues, so debt increases
“exponentially”.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">Often people use the term “increases exponentially” to mean that something grows
fast. However, things can grow fast and not be exponential, and things can grow
slowly but grow exponentially. Take the situation <script type="math/tex">10x^2</script> (which is a polynomial, and thus
not exponential) and <script type="math/tex">1.1^x</script> (which is an exponential). Let’s compare the values of these
two things for <script type="math/tex">x=1</script> to <script type="math/tex">x=6</script>.

<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent">As we can see, over the span of <script type="math/tex">x=1</script> to <script type="math/tex">x=6</script>, the polynomial expression has gone from <script type="math/tex">10</script>
to <script type="math/tex">360</script> whereas the exponential expression only went from <script type="math/tex">1.1</script> to just over <script type="math/tex">1.77</script>. But
we can also see that, as <script type="math/tex">x</script> got bigger (and thus <script type="math/tex">1.1^x</script> got bigger), increasing <script type="math/tex">x</script> by
1 kept increasing the exponential value by <em>more</em> than it increased before.
The jump from <script type="math/tex">x=1</script> to <script type="math/tex">x=2</script> was <script type="math/tex">0.11</script>, but the jump from <script type="math/tex">x=5</script> to <script type="math/tex">x=6</script> was an increase of more
than <script type="math/tex">0.16</script>... granted not exactly amazing, but that’s a relative increase of over
50%!
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="noindent">Despite what it looks like above however, <em>eventually</em> exponential growth will <em>always</em>
outpace polynomial growth... but it can take a <em>very long time</em> to start doing so.
Nonetheless it is important that growth speed isn’t what makes something “grow
exponentially”, rather it is the fact that the growth speed depends explicitly on how
much of whatever is growing is present.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">Lets see a few more examples that are, perhaps, more relevant to you.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem1"><a id="x1-1001r1"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Calculate the principal of an unsubsidized student loan</span>Let’s say that our student
loan generates interest at <script type="math/tex">9</script>% a year, compounded monthly. Since it is unsubsidized, it
generates interest while the student is in their program. Let’s say the student is in a 5
year undergraduate and masters degree program and the loan started with a principle
(initial value) of $<script type="math/tex">11,000</script>.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent">First we need to determine how much interest is generated, and how often it is
generated. A <script type="math/tex">9</script>% interest rate compounded monthly means that they take <script type="math/tex">\frac {1}{12}</script> of the total
yearly interest rate (<script type="math/tex">9</script>%) and apply that interest every month, ie 12 times a year. So
the loan generates <script type="math/tex">\frac {9}{12}</script>% additional debt every month the student is in school. Since this
is <em>additional</em> debt, it is added to the (<script type="math/tex">100</script>% of the) current principle. This means that,
every month the debt is multiplied by <script type="math/tex">1 + \frac {0.09}{12}</script>. Moreover, the student is in school for 5 years,
which is 60 months. So we can calculate the final principal with the following formula;
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> \$11,000\left (1 + \frac {0.09}{12}\right )^{60} = \$17,222.49 </script>
</p></div>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent">Buried in the above example is an explanation of the <em>compound interest formula</em>. As
with almost everything in this course, this formula seems mysterious at first,
but is actually fairly straight forward once you know what you are looking
at. The compound interest formula is as follows: If you have a principle
value of <script type="math/tex">P</script>, an annual interest rate of <script type="math/tex">r</script> (as a decimal) and it is compounded <script type="math/tex">N</script>
times a year, then the new principle value <script type="math/tex">P_n</script> after <script type="math/tex">t</script> years is: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P_N = P\left (1 + \frac {r}{N}\right )^{t\cdot N} </script> I realize that
probably looks like another alphabet soup equation, but let’s go through it
carefully.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Exponential Growth</h5>

a general example, and then we will look at specific application.

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem2"><a id="x1-2001r2"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">General Exponential Growth Example</span>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent">The key to determining exponential growth is to write out a few iterations and look
for the pattern that is occurring each iteration. This is easiest to see with an example,
so let’s do one. <br class="newline"/>Suppose you have bacterium that triples every three hours. If you start with <script type="math/tex">5</script> cells,
how many cells do you have after a week?<br class="newline"/>As mentioned, we want to write out a few iterations. But to do so we need to figure
                                                                  

                                                                  
out the following: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">What is the growth/decay multiplier
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">How many growth iterations occur over the time interval
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What is the starting size?</li></ul>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent">The first one in the list is a bit tricky; the best way to think of it (in terms of
working the most generally) is to ask what multiple of the original value is
added to the population each iteration. Since the bacteria triples, that means
that the original population remains, but twice the original population is
then added for a total of three times as much, thus our multiple is <em>two</em>, <strong>not</strong>
<em>three</em>.<br class="newline"/>The starting size was given; 5 cells. The growth iteration is every 3 hours, so over a
full week <script type="math/tex">\frac {24}{3}\cdot 7 = 56</script> growth iterations occur.<br class="newline"/>

after;

<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent">There are a couple comments to be made for the above. First, it’s important to notice
that we are getting the “<script type="math/tex">1 + 2</script>” factor by factoring out the greatest common factor in the
equality which (repeatedly) gives the “<script type="math/tex">1 + 2</script>” as a remainder after we factor out the
GCF.<br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="noindent">The other thing to address is why I left it as <script type="math/tex">1 + 2</script> instead of simplifying it to <script type="math/tex">3</script>. It is
certainly fine to simplify it to <script type="math/tex">3</script> at the end; but I have put it in this form deliberately
to demonstrate the “growth/decay multiplier”, which will be useful when we look
at other applications. For right now it is probably a good idea to go with
it until you see the other applications, at which point this format may be
clearer.<br class="newline"/>
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 87--><p class="noindent">Regardless, the pattern should have emerged when you look at the simplified result.
After <script type="math/tex">N</script> iterations, we will have <script type="math/tex">5(1 + 2)^N</script> bacteria in our sample. We can notice this by looking
at the simplified result and noting that the only change is the power of <script type="math/tex">(1+2)</script>, and that
power is always the same as the iteration number.<br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 89--><p class="noindent">Finally we return to our list of information to recall that there are <script type="math/tex">56</script> iterations
spanning the time frame we are investigating. Thus we want iteration <script type="math/tex">56</script>, and so our
value is <script type="math/tex">5(1+2)^{56} = 5\cdot 3^{56}</script>.
</p><!--l. 91--></div>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent">As we have seen above, we can build an exceptionally generic “exponential
growth/decay equation.” Specifically, given a growth/decay multiplier <script type="math/tex">r</script> and initial
population/value <script type="math/tex">P</script>, then after a number of iterations <script type="math/tex">N</script> the population is: <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(1 + r)^N </script> In the
above equation, the growth/decay multiplier <script type="math/tex">r</script> is often the hardest part to
understand. One should thing of <script type="math/tex">r</script> as being the multiple of the population that
changes (either increase or decrease) each iteration. Let’s consider several
examples.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem3"><a id="x1-2002r3"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">An isotope has a half-life of 3 years. If you start with <script type="math/tex">200</script>kg, how much do you
have after 30 years?</span>First we determine the initial population/value and the
growth/decay multiplier. The initial population/value is given, <script type="math/tex">200</script>kg. The growth/decay
multiplier is the multiple of the population/value that is added/removed each
iteration. Since this is half life, it means half the substances decays away every
iteration, so the growth/decay multiplier is <script type="math/tex">-0.5</script> because half (<script type="math/tex">0.5</script>) of the substance is
<em>removed</em> (which means it’s negative) each iteration. Finally we note that
in <script type="math/tex">30</script> years we have <script type="math/tex">\frac {30}{3} = 10</script> iterations over our time interval. Thus our answer is:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 200\big (1 + (-0.5)\big )^{10} = 200\left (\frac {1}{2}\right )^{10} </script>
</div>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment explanation" id="problem4"><a id="x1-2003r4"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">You invest $5,000 at 12% APR compounded weekly. How much do you have at the
end of 20 years?</span>Again we start by determining the initial population/value and the
growth/decay multiplier, and again the initial value is given; $5,000. The
growth/decay multiplier is how much extra is added (or subtracted) to the value each
iteration, which is exactly the interest rate that is applied each iteration. 12% APR
means 12% is added every year, but it’s compounded weekly, so that percentage is
split up (evenly) across each week. So the multiplier that is applied <em>each iteration</em> is <script type="math/tex">\frac {0.12}{52}</script>.
Finally we need the number of iterations over our time period, which is
<script type="math/tex">52</script> weeks each year for <script type="math/tex">20</script> years for a total of <script type="math/tex">52 \cdot 20 = 1040</script> iterations. Thus our answer is;
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> 5,000\left (1 + \frac {0.12}{52}\right )^{1040} </script>
<!--l. 112--></div>
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent">The formulas that you have probably seen before can be explained in this same
general context as well. Consider the classic “compound interest formula” from
before; the <script type="math/tex">P_N = P\left (1 + \frac {r}{N}\right )^{t \cdot N}</script>. If we actually interpret what these values are, we can see that <script type="math/tex">P</script> is the
initial value/population in both formulas, and in both formulas it has starts with <script type="math/tex">1 +</script> in
the parentheses. The first difference comes from the <script type="math/tex">r</script> in the general formula versus <script type="math/tex">\frac {r}{N}</script> in
                                                                  

                                                                  
the compound-interest formula. <br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="noindent">In the general formula the <script type="math/tex">r</script> stands for the growth/decay multiple; how much is
added/subtracted each iteration. In the compound interest case, this is the annual
percentage rate, divided by the number of times a year interest is compounded...
which in the compound interest formula is exactly <script type="math/tex">\frac {r}{N}</script>. So, in fact, these two values are
equal.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="noindent">The other place the two formulas are different are the exponents. In the general case
it is just <script type="math/tex">N</script>, for the number of iterations that are applied. In the compound interest
case, this is going to be the number of years we are spanning, times the number of
times a year interest is applied... which again is exactly the <script type="math/tex">t \cdot N</script> from the compound
interest formula.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="noindent">So one can see that these two formulas are exactly the same. Which may lead one to
wonder why you should learn a “new” formula if you already remember the
compound interest formula. To answer that question though, let’s have a look at
half-life next.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="noindent">The half-life formula that is typically taught is <script type="math/tex">A_0\left (\frac {1}{2}\right )^{\frac {t}{t_0}}</script>, or the even more obscure (and
pointlessly convoluted) <script type="math/tex">Pe^{kt}</script>. In the second form <script type="math/tex">k</script> is a “catch-all magic constant” that
“fixes” everything to make it work, but it is incredibly difficult to see how or why the
equation is working... which forces students to just memorize the formula and makes
it incredibly difficult to use. The first example is at least a bit more enlightening, but
fairly unwieldy. We will compare the “General Growth/Decay” equation to the first
one to see what is happening.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="noindent">In the general form <script type="math/tex">P</script> is multiplied against everything and is the initial value, in the
“classic half-life formula” the same initial value is <script type="math/tex">A_0</script>. In the general formula the
quantity inside the parentheses would be <script type="math/tex">(1 + r)</script> for the growth/decay multiplier <script type="math/tex">r</script>. As we
saw in one of the examples above, the decay multiplier for half-life is <script type="math/tex">-0.5</script>, which means
the base of the exponent in the general equation will simplify to <script type="math/tex">\frac {1}{2}</script>, which is the same
base as in the classic formula. Finally, the number of iterations that occur (<script type="math/tex">N</script> in the
general formula) is equal to the years that elapsed divided by the half-life in years.

formula there’s nothing suggesting that these two units, ie the amount of time
that passed and the amount of time needed for the half-life, are the same.
For example, a question may say the half-life is 3 months and you wait 2
decades... in which case conversion is necessary before plugging it into the
classic formula, whereas the general formula just asks you to determine the
number of iterations. )</span> </span></span> In the classic formula that is represented by the
elapsed time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and the half-life time <script type="math/tex">t_0</script>. Again these things are a bit obscure
(although not so bad as the <script type="math/tex">Pe^{kt}</script> formula), but again we see that the general formula
and the classic half-life formula result in the same formula in the half-life
case.

different dedicated “special formulas” that are normally given for each specific case.
Thus one could memorize all the various special-case formulas; compound interest,
half-life, population increases, etc. Or one could learn the general formula... which
even if you forget, can be figured out again by doing several iterations of the
growth multiplier and re-discovering the pattern, which is how we originally
deduced it back in the “General Exponential Growth Example” earlier in this
topic.
