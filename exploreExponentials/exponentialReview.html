<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>What are Exponentials?</h4>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">One typically learns exponentials as a purely mechanical action. In essence, one can
think of exponentials as “repeated multiplication”, much like how multiplication is
“repeated addition”. But this is hiding some of the more intuitive and important
understanding of exponential functions. Nonetheless it helps to learn the
mechanics (at least for numbers) before considering the modeling aspects of the
function.

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-2000"></a>Numeric Computation of Exponentials; a brief review.</h4>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">Exponentials are given in the form <script type="math/tex">(\text {base})^{(\text {exponent})}</script>. It is perhaps easiest to understand the notation
by explicitly considering the parallel we mentioned earlier; that of multiplication and
addition.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">Comparing exponents to multiplication and multiplication to addition<br class="newline"/>
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent">When you were (very) young and learning addition, you probably had moments of
adding the same number to itself repeatedly. In fact, counting is doing exactly this
with the number <script type="math/tex">1</script>. So, counting <script type="math/tex">1,2,3,4,5</script> is really just adding <script type="math/tex">1</script> to itself 5 times and saying
aloud each substep. As you got (slightly) older it probably got bothersome to add the
same number to itself over and over, and this is often when multiplication is
introduced.<br class="newline"/>Thus we can think of multiplication (and it is in fact defined to be) just adding
something over and over. Instead of computing <script type="math/tex">4 + 4 + 4</script> we can say we have <script type="math/tex">3</script> ‘fours’ and
compute it as <script type="math/tex">3 \cdot 4 = 12</script>. This is probably just about boring you into a stupor here, so let’s
move to exponents.<br class="newline"/>Exponentials are the same idea. Instead of multiplying <script type="math/tex">4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4</script> we can say we have <script type="math/tex">3</script> ‘fours’
that are being multiplied. Obviously we can’t use the same symbol to represent this
since if we wrote <script type="math/tex">3 \cdot 4</script> we would interpret that as <script type="math/tex">4 + 4 + 4</script> not <script type="math/tex">4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4</script>. Thus to tell the difference we put
the <script type="math/tex">3</script> in a different spot, namely we write <script type="math/tex">4^3</script>.<br class="newline"/>This may seem obvious and a waste of time, but recognizing that all an exponent is,
is a way of writing repeated multiplication, we can actually extract <em>almost all</em> the
important features of exponents from just remembering that one little detail. This is
what we will do next.
