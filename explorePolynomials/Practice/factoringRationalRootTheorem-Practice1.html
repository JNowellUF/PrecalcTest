Please be aware! Xronos is very good at making sure the factored polynomial you
have entered is the same polynomial. It is less reliable to know if you have entered a
<em>fully factored version</em> of that polynomial. To be sure that your factored version is
<strong>fully</strong> factored, you should check two things:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Every factor is degree 1 or degree 2 polynomial (a linear expression or a
     quadratic).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If the factor is a quadratic, then the discriminate (<script type="math/tex">b^2-4ac</script>) <strong>must be negative</strong>.
     If it is Zero or positive, then that term can be factored further and you
     should try to do so.</li></ul>
