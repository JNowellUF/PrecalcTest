<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">We know an awful lot about polynomials, but it relies on the <em>very specific</em> structure
of a polynomial, and thus it is <em>paramount</em> that one can correctly recognize what is,
and isn’t, a polynomial to use these tools.

<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">Before we can study polynomials we need to know what they are, and before we
introduce polynomials, we first need to define their individual terms, ie monomials;
whose definition we give below:
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem1"><a id="x1-5r1"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Monomial</span> A term of the form <script type="math/tex">ax^n</script> for some constant <script type="math/tex">a</script> and some non-negative integer <script type="math/tex">n</script>.
From “mono” meaning “one” and “nomen” meaning “name”.
</div>
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">Essentially a monomial is a single term with a coefficient and <script type="math/tex">x</script> to non-negative a
whole number (possibly zero) power. Thus terms like <script type="math/tex">4x^2</script>, <script type="math/tex">13x^{12}</script> and <script type="math/tex">17</script> are all monomials; the
last is a monomial because it can be written as <script type="math/tex">17x^0</script>.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent">Polynomials are just the sums and differences of different monomials. Since we will
often encounter polynomials with only two terms, such as <script type="math/tex">x - 3</script>, we give those a speical
name as well; binomials. Thus the expressions <script type="math/tex">3x^6 - 12x^4 + 2x^3 + 12</script>, <script type="math/tex">3x^2 - 2x + 1</script>, and <script type="math/tex">13</script>, would all qualify as
polynomials.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem2"><a id="x1-6r2"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Polynomial</span> A function or expression that is entirely composed of the sum or
differences of monomials. From “poly” meaning “many”.
</div>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent">Keep in mind that any single term that is not a monomial can prevent an expression
from being classified as a polynomial. For example, the expression <script type="math/tex">3x^2 + 12x - \sqrt {x}</script> is not a
polynomial; even though the first two terms are both monomials, the last term (<script type="math/tex">\sqrt {x}</script>) is
not, and thus the overall expression is <em>not</em> a polynomial.
</p>
<div role="article" class="problem-environment question" id="problem3"> <strong>    1 :</strong>  <a id="x1-7r3"></a>  Which of the following are polynomials? (Select all that are correct) <div class="multiple-choice" id="problem4"><span class="choice correct" id="choice1"><script type="math/tex">x^5 + 13x^2 - 1</script></span> <span class="choice correct" id="choice2"><script type="math/tex">f(x) = 1</script></span> <span class="choice " id="choice3"><script type="math/tex">g(x) = \sqrt {x} + 12</script></span> <span class="choice " id="choice4"><script type="math/tex">(e^x)^2 + 3x - 7</script></span> <span class="choice correct" id="choice5"><script type="math/tex">x^7 + 12x^2 - x</script></span> </div>
</div>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent">As we will see, the term with the highest power in the polynomial can provide us
with a considerable information. Because of this there is a convention to write
polynomials by adding the monomials starting with the largest power down to the
smallest power, <em>but this is convention only and is not always done!</em> Be sure to double
check any polynomial to see if it is written in this form or not. This convention is
                                                                  

                                                                  
why we refer to the term with the highest power as the <em>leading term</em>, whose
coefficient is the <em>leading coefficient</em>, and whose degree is the <em>degree of the
polynomial</em>.

<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem5"><a id="x1-8r4"></a><span class="theorem-like-title">Leading Term (of a polynomial)</span> The <em>leading term</em> of a polynomial is the term with
the largest exponent, along with its coefficient. Another way to describe it
(which is where this term gets its name) is that; if we arrange the polynomial
from highest to lowest power, than the first term is the so-called ‘leading
term’.<br class="newline"/><strong>For Example:</strong> For the polynomial <script type="math/tex">p(x) = x^2 - 13x^3 + 4x - 1</script> we could rewrite it in descending order of
exponents, to get <script type="math/tex">p(x) = -13x^3 + x^2 + 4x - 1</script> which makes clear that <script type="math/tex">-13x^3</script> as the ‘leading term’ of <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script>.
